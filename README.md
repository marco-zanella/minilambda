# Minilambda
### Minimalist functional core programming language, just for fun.

Minilambda is a core functional programming language created in one day for training purposes.

Since it was created in one day, it does not implement additional, fancy features. Nevertheless, you can play around with it and getting an idea about how to define a programming language and write an interpreter for it. Implementation is in Haskell.

## Examples
Here are some code examples which can run in Minilambda:
  >> 42
  42
